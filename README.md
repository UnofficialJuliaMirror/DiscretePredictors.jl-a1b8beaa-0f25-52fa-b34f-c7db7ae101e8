# DiscretePredictors

#### Created by Vishnu Raj (@v-i-s-h)

DiscretePredictor is a collection of algorithms for discrete sequence prediction. It provides a commmon API for a number of discrete sequence prediction algorithms. My goals with the package are:
- **Simple Interface**
- **Easily Extendable**
- **Reproducible Research**
